A class serves as a blueprint that defines attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on the data. OOP promotes modularity, reusability, and scalability by using four key principles: encapsulation, which restricts direct access to object data to ensure security and maintainability; abstraction, which hides complex details and exposes only essential functionalities; inheritance, which allows new classes to derive properties and behaviors from existing ones, reducing code duplication; and polymorphism, which enables a single interface to represent different data types or methods. This approach makes code more structured, easier to debug, and adaptable to real-world applications. OOP is widely used in modern programming languages like Python, Java, C++, and C# to build efficient and scalable software systems."

        "- Method chaining in Python OOP is a technique where multiple methods are called on the same object in a single line, improving code readability and conciseness. This is achieved by designing methods to return the self object (return self), allowing subsequent method calls to be linked together. Method chaining is commonly used in builder patterns, data manipulation, and fluent interfaces, where modifications to an object can be applied step by step."

        "- The __call__ method in Python is a special dunder (double underscore) method that allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. When a class defines the __call__ method, its objects can be invoked using parentheses (), just like regular functions. This feature is useful in scenarios such as creating callable objects, implementing decorators, or designing function wrappers. For example, in a Multiplier class, defining __call__(self, x) allows an instance to be used as multiply_by_2(5), returning 10. This makes objects behave like functions while still maintaining object-oriented advantages, such as storing state. Using __call__ can lead to more flexible, reusable, and expressive code, particularly in function-based design patterns."
